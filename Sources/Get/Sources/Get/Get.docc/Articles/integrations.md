# Integrations

Learn how to extend ``APIClient`` using third-party frameworks.

### Pulse

You can easily add logging to your API client using [Pulse](https://github.com/kean/Pulse). It is a one-line setup.

```swift
let client = APIClient(baseURL: URL(string: "https://api.github.com")) {
    $0.sessionDelegate = PulseCore.URLSessionProxyDelegate()
}
```

With Pulse, you can inspect logs directly on your device – and it supports _all_ Apple platforms. And you can share the logs at any time and view them on a big screen using [Pulse Pro](https://kean.blog/pulse/guides/pulse-pro).

### CreateAPI

With [CreateAPI](https://github.com/kean/CreateAPI), you can take your backend OpenAPI spec, and generate all of the response entities and even requests for ``APIClient``.

```swift
generate api.github.yaml --output ./OctoKit --module "OctoKit"
```

> Check out [App Store Connect Swift SDK](https://github.com/AvdLee/appstoreconnect-swift-sdk) that uses [CreateAPI](https://github.com/kean/CreateAPI) for code generation.

### Other Extensions

Get is a lean framework with a lot of flexibility and customization points. It makes it very easy to learn and use, but you'll need to install additional modules for certain features.

- [Mocker](https://github.com/WeTransfer/Mocker) – mocking network requests for testing purposes
- [URLQueryEncoder](https://github.com/CreateAPI/URLQueryEncoder) – URL query encoder with `Codable` support
- [MultipartFormDataKit](https://github.com/Kuniwak/MultipartFormDataKit) – adds support for `multipart/form-data`
- [NaiveDate](https://github.com/CreateAPI/NaiveDate) – working with dates without timezones
